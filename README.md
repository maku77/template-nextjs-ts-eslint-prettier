# Next.js example with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript, ESLint and Prettier.

## How to use it?

```
$ yarn dev    # Start dev server
$ yarn build  # Build for release
$ yarn lint   # Lint with Prettier and ESLint
$ yarn fix    # Autofix with Prettier and ESLint
```

When we run `next dev` the next time, Next.js will start looking for any `.ts` or `.tsx` files in our project and builds it.
Next.js has built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for Next.js' modules straight away.
